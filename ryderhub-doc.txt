created gmail auto invoice ulploader interface
* required more validation i.e date validation for sending date to jar file
* (would need database table to store gmail password and recent upload info...)
* weekly email scan and upload feature if set up by the user 
for running email uploader, created nodejs server running from app.js at port 8081 
autoupload form sends data to port 8081, nodejs then runs jar file with that data
email jar file inputs are useremail, password, enddate(yyyy-mm-dd), startdate(yyyy-mm-dd),ryderid
