work iv completed:

frontend - using template angular application
using node js as server
fixing input validation code errors
added exressjs to package.json as a dependency (learning to implement it) -edit failed to implement it
authenticate users (write service)
using php to communicate backend server to nodejs server and AngularJS

completed - 1, create database for files(invoices maybe just file names +save all files in folder)
                do error checking on file upload ie only pdfs + only upload if file doesnt exist in DB
                only allow invoice upload if ryder id is set need id for changing invoice file names
created gmail auto invoice ulploader interface
* required more validation i.e date validation for sending date to jar file
* (would need database table to store gmail password and recent upload info...)
* weekly email scan and upload feature if set up by the user 
for running email uploader, created nodejs server running from app.js at port 8081 
autoupload form sends data to port 8081, nodejs then runs jar file with that data
email jar file inputs are useremail, password, enddate(yyyy-mm-dd), startdate(yyyy-mm-dd),ryderid
3, test cache dir jar watcher see if its working correctly
    - need to add to jar (emailuploader) to check if file exists in cache else send to temp
*need to use cookies and localstorage to persist user data through page refreshes
wrote php script and angularjs http method to get ryder id based on email input
* bug file upload runs with no file selected fix later
cleaned up dashboard view a little
* before going live i must encript password and change scripts + verify
