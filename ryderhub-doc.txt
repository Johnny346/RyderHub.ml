                do error checking on file upload ie only pdfs + only upload if file doesnt exist in DB
                only allow invoice upload if ryder id is set need id for changing invoice file names
created gmail auto invoice ulploader interface
* required more validation i.e date validation for sending date to jar file
* (would need database table to store gmail password and recent upload info...)

for running email uploader, created nodejs server running from app.js at port 8081 
autoupload form sends data to port 8081, nodejs then runs jar file with that data
email jar file inputs are useremail, password, enddate(yyyy-mm-dd), startdate(yyyy-mm-dd),ryderid
